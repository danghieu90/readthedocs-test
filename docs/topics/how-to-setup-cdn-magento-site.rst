How to setup Cloudflare CDN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first CDN I would like to list here is Cloudflare (http://cloudflare.com). They have 4 packages: Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise.



Step 1: How does Cloudflare work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CloudFlare protects and accelerates any website online. Once your website is a part of the CloudFlare community, its web traffic is routed through our intelligent global network. We automatically optimize the delivery of your web pages so your visitors get the fastest page load times and best performance. We also block threats and limit abusive bots and crawlers from wasting your bandwidth and server resources. The result: CloudFlare-powered websites see a significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.

Step 2: Create a CloudFlare account and add a website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Signing up for CloudFlare is incredibly easy and takes less than 5 minutes. `This article`_ outlines the steps to successfully create an account and add your first website.


Step 3: Change your domain name servers to CloudFlare
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you create your CloudFlare account or add an additional website, you are provided the CloudFlare name servers for your domain. The final step is to update the name servers for your domain with the CloudFlare name servers assigned to your domain.
