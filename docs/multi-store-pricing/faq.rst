Q: I've got error: ``Destination folder not writable media/magecheckout/securedcheckout/css/generator``

A: You have to make sure folder ``media\magecheckout\securedcheckout\css\generator`` is writable, type::
	
	chmod 777 media\magecheckout\securedcheckout\css\generator


Is the source code encoded/encrypted in any way?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No, the code is 100% open source instead of fixed code in any way, that means you can read it and custom it as needs.

Because in our opinion, the encoding is cumbersome for our clients when they want to make extension more suitable for their stores and more special to their audience.
