By generating many attributes, customers can find the best stores with needed products and nearest to their position regardless of location. Three steps for the most effective seeking:

* **Search by area** asks to enter country, city manually or more conveniently, the extension can auto-locate customer’s current position by Geocode technology if store admin approves.

* **Search by distance** offers specific radius to find stores (the maximum and minimum radius is set by you)

For example: find stores which sell men’s clothes are within 5 kilometers distance from Brooklyn, New York.

After that, click on **Submit** button to start seeking.
